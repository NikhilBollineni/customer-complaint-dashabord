# Customer Complaint Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases a customer complaint analysis dashboard for a company that manufactures and sells medical products. It provides comprehensive insights into complaint statistics, thereby assisting the company in improving its customer service and product quality.

The dataset used in this dashboard is a simulated real-world dataset, created using Excel functions. It represents diverse customer types (like hospitals, dental clinics, nursing homes, etc.), various categories of complaints (device failure, privacy and confidentiality, environmental conditions, etc.), and different product groups (urological endoscopy, laparoscopic surgery, etc.)

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include:**

- Total Complaint Analysis
- Unsolved Complaints
- Solved Rate
- Unsolved Rate
- Average Resolution in Days

**Visualizations include:**

- **Complaints by Countries (Table Format):** Displays total, solved, and unsolved complaints by country. Unsolved complaints are highlighted in red.

- **Total vs Solved vs Unsolved (Bar Chart):** A horizontal bar chart showcasing the total number of complaints, alongside those resolved and unresolved.

- **Complaints by Customer Type (Bar Chart):** A visual representation of complaints sorted by customer type (hospitals, dental clinics, nursing homes, etc.).

- **Complaints by Category (Bar Chart):** Highlights the different categories of complaints received, such as device failure, privacy and confidentiality, environmental conditions, etc.

- **Complaints by Product Group (Bar Chart):** Highlights the different product groups receiving complaints, such as urological endoscopy, laparoscopic surgery, etc.

The dashboard is designed to provide quick and clear insights to stakeholders on areas that need immediate attention and the improvement measures they need to take. It not only highlights the problems at hand but also tracks progress over time. The goal is to reduce the number of complaints and increase customer satisfaction.
